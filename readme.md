# Tinacious Responsive Video jQuery Plugin

This plugin was developed to make it easy to implement a fluid and responsive video.

The CSS it uses was acquired from a variety of internet resources without luck of finding an original author.

I made it easy to use. All you need to know is the video ID and whether it's a YouTube or Vimeo video.

## How it Works

The plugin renders proper HTML and uses the attached CSS file to embed your video. 

The video will expand to 100% of its container. Keep this in mind when using it with media queries.

## Instructions

1. Reference [jQuery](http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js)
2. Reference `tinaciousResponsiveVid.js` or `tinaciousResponsiveVid.min.js`
3. Reference `tinaciousResponsiveVid.css`

### HTML

Create a blank element where you want your video to go.
```html
<div class="my_video"></div>
```
Yep, that's it. Your video will append to the targeted element.

### CSS

The following code is all of the CSS required for this plugin to work:
```css
.responsive-video object, .responsive-video iframe {
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
}
.responsive-video {
	position: relative;
	padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 */
	height: 0;
}
.standardDef {
	padding-bottom: 20%; /* 4:3 */
}
```
Since the video will expand to 100% of the width of its container, you can specify that width on the targeted element, e.g.:

```css
.my_video {
	width: 50%; /* optional to whatever size you want */
}
```
The video will be fluid and responsive within that container.

### Javascript

Initialize your script on document ready:

```js
$(document).ready(function(){
	$('.my_video').tinaciousResponsiveVid({
		id: '', // Video ID goes here
		type: 'vimeo', // Video service name goes here. Currently supports YouTube and Vimeo (default)
		ratio: 'widescreen' // Choose your aspect ratio â€“ widescreen is 16:9 (default), standard is 4:3
	});
});
```

If you do not pass variables through the function, the default video service is Vimeo and the video that will play is a screencast on creating content for a Content Management Systems. The default aspect ratio is widescreen.

The following is perfectly valid:

```js
$(document).ready(function(){
	$('.my_video').tinaciousResponsiveVid({
		id: '123456'
	});
});
```
It will play video with ID 123456 on Vimeo.

### Results

Using this jQuery:

```js
$(document).ready(function(){
	$('.my_video').tinaciousResponsiveVid({
		id: '-O3gTUTsYbU',
		type: 'youtube'
	});
});
```

Will render the following HTML"

```html
<div class="my_video">
	<h2>With Parameters Passed Through</h2>
	<div class="responsive-video">
		<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-O3gTUTsYbU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
	</div>
</div>
```
